# ðŸ›¡ Vue Router Shield

Looking for a clean and elegent way to define navigation guards in your Vue.js application ? This library is made for you ! Whether you want to authenticate your users across your application, or just fetch some data before entering a view, this is a perfect fit.

## Installation ðŸ”½

```bash
npm install vue-router-shield
# or
yarn add vue-router-shield
```

```js
import VueRouterShield from 'vue-router-shield'

Vue.use(VueRouterShield, {
  router // A router instance must be given
})
```

## Example ðŸ”½

Unlike classic [navigation guards](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html), these are defined at the route level. Doing so has several advantages, as it helps your views to stay light and allows the guards to be reused elsewhere. Using a concise syntax, you can define the guards to be executed before entering the route, before the route is updated, or both. Let's create a guard that will be called `BeforeEach` navigations and log a greeting message :

```js
import { BeforeEach } from 'vue-router-shield'

export default BeforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  console.log('Hello !')
  
  next()
})
```

Now, this guard must be bound to the route on which we want it to be executed :

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      component: {},
      meta: { guard: [SayHello] }
    }
  ]
})
```

## Guards ðŸ”½

As said above, the guards can be executed in three different ways :

- `BeforeEach` guards are executed when the route they're bound to is **entered or updated**.
- `BeforeUpdate` guards are executed **only** when the route they're bound to is **updated**.
- `BeforeEnter` guards are executed **only** when the route they're bound to is **entered**.

To make your guards behave like one of these three, just import the corresponding wrapper function :

```js
// BeforeEach
import { BeforeEach } from 'vue-router-shield'

export default BeforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  next()
})

// BeforeUpdate
import { BeforeUpdate } from 'vue-router-shield'

export default BeforeUpdate((to, from, next) => {
  next()
})

// BeforeEnter
import { BeforeEnter } from 'vue-router-shield'

export default BeforeEnter((to, from, next) => {
  next()
})
```
